  **Gameplay**  
  Venture into a foreboding fortress to gather riches with only a torch to guide you. Use sight, sound and the tools at hand to navigate the dark tunnels and unlock the Gorged One's chamber. Leaving empty-handed is not an optionâ€¦  
  *Inspired by Swedish board game Drakborgen.*

  **About**  
  Greed & Darkness was made as a student project by a small team in Gothenburg, Sweden.  
  After launch, the game was picked up by some larger YouTube channels, leading to us gaining some virality online (16 000 downloads on itch.io and a combined 400 000+ views on YouTube). We decided to continue development and to start a business.  
  Our most recent demo is now released on Steam as of **July 18, 2025**.
